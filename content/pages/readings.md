The Constitutional Convention
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Koch, Adrienne, ed. *Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 Reported by James Madison*. New York, NY: W.W. Norton, 1987, introduction, Madison's preface, pp. 21- 166. ISBN: 9780393304053.

\- This includes the convention's opening; presentation of the Virginia plan; presentation and rejection of the alternative New Jersey plan; and resumption of debate based on the resolutions Virginia had proposed. Note the resolutions on pp. 148-51, since the debates immediately thereafter are keyed to them. Skim the make-or-break debates on resolutions 7 and 8 that runs from pp. 220-98, with the little additional flare-up on 299-302. Thereafter, debates proceeded with less fireworks, and you can pick and choose which issues to follow. Discussion over whether Congress should veto state laws, as Madison insisted, is on 304-05; debates over the presidency, which many said was the hardest issue the convention faced, are on pp. 306-14, 322-35, 356-72. As a result of these discussions, the convention produced a revised set of resolutions (pp. 379-85), which a Committee of Detail made into a draft constitution while the convention adjourned from July 26-August 6 (see pp. 385-96). Then it debated the draft, revisiting issues it had discussed before in the light of other decisions. Note predictions of the future that emerged during a discussion of suffrage, pp. 402-04; and discussions of slavery and the slave trade on pp. 409-13, 502-08. In late August the convention set up a Committee of Eleven to propose solutions to several problems it hadn't solved. The committee's recommendations opened another round of debates, especially on the executive (see 573-79, 582-97, and 605-66 on impeachment). Finally, on September 12, a Committee of Style set up to incorporate changes into the draft constitution and refine its wording presented its report (616-27). That led to still more debates, in the course of which George Mason raised the issue of a bill of rights (630). Read also the record of the convention's closing days, 650-59.

Exploring the West

\- {{% resource_link "64069421-2baa-4a71-a78d-90d7272989a8" "Letter from President Thomas Jefferson" %}}

Moulton, Gary E., ed. *The Lewis and Clark Journals*. New York, NY: Basic Books, 2004. ISBN: 9780803280397.

\- Read the preface, introduction, "editorial principles," and afterword. Feel free to skim, and don't be surprised if it takes awhile to get into the story. There are memorable passages in the book, which tells the tale of a great adventure and a lot about the country and its peoples at that time, but the "good parts" are scattered, which makes it difficult to define just which pages to read.

\- This edition provides an extensive introduction, which should make navigating the journals easier. However, papers should be based on the journals themselves, not those parts supplied by the editor.

The Lincoln-Douglas Debates; Lincoln
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Holzer, Harry, ed. *The Lincoln-Douglas Debates: The First Complete, Unexpurgated Text*. New York, NY: Fordham University Press, 2004. ISBN: 9780823223428.

\- Read the Preface, Introduction, descriptions of "the scene" for each of the debates, and the appendix as well as the debates themselves, much of which you can skim. The speeches are long, but include many redundancies since the speakers went over the same issues, sometimes reading passages from previous speeches, again and again. Much of the content was pretty well established after the first three debates, but it's useful to ask who you think came out best in the various debates, and, more important, whether the speakers' positions changed. For example, does Lincoln state his position differently in Ottawa and Freeport, in the northern part of Illinois, settled by migrants from free states, than in Charleston or Alton, settled by people from the South who were in general more pro-slavery? As this edition (do not accept substitutes!) makes clear, the debates took place outside, without microphones, to audiences that often interrupted the speakers. Even their interjections, which Holzer scrupulously includes, are interesting.

Also Lincoln's {{% resource_link "26774e12-58e2-4ef7-a127-564c1de435d9" "\"House Divided\" speech" %}} at Springfield, June 16, 1858, when he accepted the Republicans' nomination for senator (you should probably read this before reading the Lincoln-Douglas debates), his {{% resource_link "979f4157-f473-4e0a-9379-08a952120a2b" "First Inaugural Address" %}} (1861), the {{% resource_link "052b1855-8b6e-4bb3-8980-631c90aa228e" "Gettysburg Address" %}} (1863), and his {{% resource_link "caee0e7f-fd9b-46da-bf75-14cb69c40aad" "Second Inaugural Address" %}} (1865), reliable versions of which are available at: {{% resource_link "6604f46c-773c-492d-a513-fb2714e7501e" "Speeches of Abraham Lincoln" %}}.

Ulysses S. Grant and the Civil War
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
Grant, Ulysses S. *Personal Memoirs*. New York, NY: Penguin, 1999. ISBN: 9780140437010. (Especially pp. xiii-xxvi, 3-54, 92-133, read about some battle of the Civil War (Shiloh, 177-99, for example; Vicksburg was more important, but the account is also much longer), 376-82, 525 (bottom) -35, 558-61, 580-640.
